Team discovery encourages collaboration by easing the onboarding process for new team members. When team discovery is enabled, users who have a verified email address with your company's domain can request to join your Postman team.

## Enabling team discovery

* Free users: Next to your avatar, select the dropdown list next to **Upgrade > Manage Team**.
* Paid users: Next to your avatar, select **Team > Manage Team**.

In [Team Settings](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general), select **Team discovery** on the left, then select **Enable team discovery**. This will enable anyone from your domain to find and request to join your team.

> Team Admins will receive an email notification when team discovery is enabled.

You can optionally add a question for pending team members to answer when they request to join your team. Enter your question and select **Update Question**. Anyone who requests to join the team will be prompted with the question. If you don't specify a question, team members can still add a note when they request to join the team.

All [Team Admins](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) will receive a notification when someone makes a request to join your team, including their answer to any question you set, or an optional note.

## Finding teams within your organization

When you first join Postman using an email address with your company's domain, Postman provides you with a list of available teams you can join within your organization.

Select **Request Access** next to a team, then answer the question set by the Team Admin, if there is one. You can also add an optional note. Select **Request to Join**.

Once you've verified your account, the Team Admins will receive a notification of your request. When they approve it, you'll be able to access the team and collaborate on API projects within it.
