Postman recommends keeping your APIs in sync between your public workspace and your repository. This keeps your APIs current on [the Public API Network](/docs/getting-started/exploring-public-api-network/), enabling API consumers to fork the latest version of your APIs. Postman has multiple integrations for popular third-party solutions to help keep your APIs in sync.

The following integrations are a few options you can use to keep your API definition and collections in sync with your repository:

* [GitHub](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/github)
* [GitLab](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/gitlab)
* [Bitbucket](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/bitbucket)
* [APIMatic](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/apimatic)

To learn more about Postman's integrations, see [Integrating with Postman](/docs/integrations/intro-integrations/) and [Using a remote Git repository](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/using-external-git-repo/).
