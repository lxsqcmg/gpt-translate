[Mock servers](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/) simulate an API by returning predefined data, enabling you to develop or test against an API before it's production-ready (or without using production data). In Postman, mock servers rely on [examples](/docs/sending-requests/examples/) saved in a collection to return mock data. Follow the steps below to get a hands-on demonstration of how mock servers and examples work together, and to learn how you can integrate them into your API workflow.

## Creating a mock server

The steps below walk you through the process of creating a mock server in Postman. First, you'll set up some basics that are required for mock servers to work. Once your mock server is up and running, you'll send requests to it and understand how your examples are used to return data.

### Step 1: Send a request

In Postman, open a new request by selecting **+** or by selecting **New > HTTP**. Leave `GET` as the method, and for the request URL enter `https://postman-echo.com/get?test=123`. When ready, select **Send**.

This request calls the [Postman Echo](https://docs.postman-echo.com/#078883ea-ac9e-842e-8f41-784b59a33722) service which you can use to test REST or SOAP clients and make sample API calls. The resulting response displays in the response pane.

### Step 2: Save the request to a collection

Select **Save** to save the request in a collection. [Collections](/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/) are groups of requests that you can use to organize your work and create API workflows.

<img alt="Save a request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mock-examples-step2a-v9-1.jpg" width="808px">

Enter a **Request name**. Instead of selecting an existing collection in **Save to**, select **New Collection**. Enter `C1` for the collection name and select **Create**. Then select **Save** to save the request to the new collection.

<img alt="Save a request to a new collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mock-examples-step2b-v9-1.jpg" width="482px">

### Step 3: Save a response as an example

To save the response you received from the Postman Echo service, select **Save Response > Save as example**. The example is saved underneath the request, inside the `C1` collection.

<img alt="Save an example" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/mock-examples-step3a-v10.jpg" width="300px">

Select **Collections** in the sidebar, expand the `C1` collection and the request, and then select the example to open it.

<img alt="Open an example" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mock-examples-step3b-v9-1.jpg" width="456px">

To rename the example, select the edit icon <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-edit-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="18px"> next to the name. Rename the example `E1`. Note that the request method, URL, and status code are all saved as part of the example. Postman uses these items to determine which responses are returned by a mock server.

<img alt="Rename an example" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mock-examples-step3c-v9-1.jpg" width="808px">

### Step 4: Create a mock server for the collection

Now that you've added an example to your collection, you're ready to set up a mock server. Select **Collections** in the sidebar. Select the more actions icon <img alt="More actions icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-more-actions-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the `C1` collection, and then select **Mock collection**.

<img alt="Mock a collection" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mock-examples-step4a-v9-1.jpg" width="455px">

For **Mock server name**, enter `M1`. You can also specify other details for your mock server as needed:

* **Collection** is already set to `C1`, as you chose to mock this collection.
* If your saved example uses [environment variables](/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/) (like `{{base_url}}/my/path`), you must select the corresponding **Environment** or the mock server won't work. In this case, the example doesn't use any variables, so you can select **No Environment**.
* By default, mock servers are publicly accessible. If you select the **Make mock server private** checkbox, the mock server will no longer be public. You can share it with team members and [provide permission](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/) to edit or view. For now, do not select this checkbox.

When you're done configuring the mock server, select **Create Mock Server**. You can access the mock server at any time by selecting **Mock Servers** in the sidebar.

<img alt="Create a mock server" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mock-examples-step4b-v9-1.jpg" width="779px">

> You can also create a mock server [using the Postman API](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/mock-with-api/).

### Step 5: Send a request to the mock server

Now that you've created the mock server `M1`, you can send a request to the mock endpoint.

First, copy the mock server URL. Select **Mock Servers** in the sidebar, select the `M1` mock server, and then select **Copy Mock URL**.

<img alt="Copy mock URL" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mock-examples-step5a-v9-1.jpg" width="808px">

Next, create a new request by selecting **+** or by selecting **New > HTTP**. Paste the mock URL into the new request and select **Send**.

<img alt="Mock server error response" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/mock-examples-step5b-v10.jpg" width="750px">

Sending this request returns an error. The reason is because you didn't add a path to the mock server URL, and there's no matching saved example with an undefined path and the request method `GET`. Responses returned by the mock service are entirely dependent on the URL and method in your saved examples.

You do, however, have a saved example with the path `/get` and the request method `GET`. Add `/get` to the end of the mock server URL and send the request again. This time you receive the expected response from the mock server.

<img alt="Mock server correct response" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/mock-examples-step5c-v10.jpg" width="750px">

### Step 6: Add another example

To further demonstrate how responses from the mock service are entirely dependent on your saved examples, add another example to the `C1` collection. Repeat steps 1 to 3 above to save a request to the collection and then save the response as an example `E2`, this time using the request URL `https://postman-echo.com/test`.

<img alt="Add a second example" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mock-examples-step6a-v9-1.jpg" width="808px">

Sending a `GET` request to `https://postman-echo.com/test` returns a 404 error, which you saved as another example. The collection `C1` has two requests and two saved examples:

* **Example E1** - `GET` request to path `/get`
* **Example E2** - `GET` request to path `/test`

Finally, repeat [step 5](#step-5-send-a-request-to-the-mock-server), but this time add the path `/test` to the end of the mock server URL when sending the request. This returns the expected 404 response.

<img alt="Send another request to the mock server" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/mock-examples-step6b-v10.jpg" width="750px">

> **Your examples can vary depending on the URL endpoint, request method, or status code.** If you have multiple examples, you can choose to save each example under a unique endpoint URL, like you saw in this demonstration with `/get` and `/test`. If you have saved examples with different response status codes, you can send an authenticated request to the mock server along with the `x-mock-response-code` header specifying which integer response code your returned response needs to match.

## Using query parameters

Postman's mock service uses a [matching algorithm](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/matching-algorithm/) to select the most appropriate saved example to return in response to a request. As part of this algorithm, the mock server looks at the query parameters when matching requests to saved examples. If you have examples that differ only in their query parameters, you can mock different responses for different query parameters on the same request path. In this case, the mock server will return the exact response matching that request path and the corresponding query parameters.

Here's a scenario that illustrates how matching query parameters works:

* The collection **Query Params Demo** has one request **Request1** with two examples, **Example1** and **Example2**.
* In **Example1**, the parameter `id` has a value of `1`:

    <img alt="Query parameters example 1" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mock-examples-params1-v9-1.jpg" width="808px">

* In **Example2**, the parameter `id` has a value of `5`:

    <img alt="Query parameters example 2" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mock-examples-params2-v9-1.jpg" width="808px">

* In this scenario, **Example1** and **Example2** are passing `1` and `5` respectively. When you send a request to the mock server URL and pass these different query parameters, Postman returns the exact response that matches both the path and the passed parameters.

    <img alt="Query parameters mock response" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/mock-examples-params3-v10.jpg" width="808px">

> If no exact match is found, Postman returns the best response based on its [matching algorithm](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/matching-algorithm/).

## Mocking GraphQL queries

Postman's mock service enables you to mock GraphQL queries. To mock GraphQL queries, make a request to the mock server using the request path and request body saved in the examples in the mocked collection.

Make sure to set the `Content-type` header to `application/json` in your examples.

<img alt="Query parameters example 1" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mock-examples-graphql1-v9-1.jpg" width="809px">

Also make sure to pass the `x-mock-match-request-body` header with a value of `true` when sending a request to the mock server URL.
