Postman can convert an API request into a code snippet, and you can choose the programming language or framework. You can use this generated code snippet in your front-end applications.

> This guide has information about generating code snippets from API requests. For information about generating server-side boilerplate code from an API specification, see [Generating server code](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/developing-an-api/generating-server-code/).

## Contents

* [Generating code snippets in Postman](#generating-code-snippets-in-postman)

* [Supported languages and frameworks](#supported-languages-and-frameworks)

## Generating code snippets in Postman

1. Open the request you want to use for a code snippet, then select the code icon <img alt="Code icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-code-snippet.jpg#icon" width="16px"> in the right pane.

    <img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/generate-code-right-sidebar-v9.jpg" width="300px" alt="Open code snippets"/>

1. Select a [language or framework](#supported-languages-and-frameworks) from the dropdown list.
1. Select the copy icon <img alt="Copy icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-copy-v9.jpg#icon" width="15px"> to copy the code snippet to your clipboard.

1. For more configuration options, like the indentation type and count, select the settings icon <img alt="Settings icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-settings-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> next to the dropdown list. The settings vary based on the chosen language or framework.
