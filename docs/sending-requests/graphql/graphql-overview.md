Postman can make HTTP calls using GraphQL, an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs.

You can use GraphQL with Postman in two ways:

* Using the Postman GraphQL client

    Postman's GraphQL client enables you to easily explore schemas with introspection and quickly build [queries, mutations, and subscriptions](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-client-first-request/#about-graphql-request) to get the data you need. See [About the GraphQL client](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-client-overview/) to learn more.

* Using the Postman HTTP request interface

    Postman's HTTP request interface supports sending GraphQL queries in the request body, using GraphQL variables, and introspection and importing GraphQL schemas. See [Using GraphQL requests with the HTTP request interface](/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-http/) to learn more.
