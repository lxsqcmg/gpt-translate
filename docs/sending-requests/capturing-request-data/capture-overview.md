Capturing HTTP traffic is an important tool for API development and testing. When you enable request capturing in Postman, you can inspect the requests passing between client applications and your API and save them to a collection. You can then use the saved request information to understand how your API is behaving and to assist with debugging.

Postman's built-in proxy and Postman Interceptor provide two ways to capture HTTP and HTTPS traffic. You can also use the proxy or Interceptor to capture and sync cookies to the Postman cookie jar.

To capture traffic, first start the proxy or Interceptor, and then begin a debug session. A session represents a specific time frame during which you want to capture traffic (for example, while a client application is sending a series of requests that you want to observe or debug).

After you begin a debug session, you can pause and resume capturing, or clear any captured traffic, without stopping the proxy or Interceptor. Use Postman's search and filtering capabilities to narrow down the requests based on the criteria you choose.

## Using the Postman proxy

A proxy is an intermediary server that sits between a client application (like a mobile app or a web browser) and the destination server that the client is communicating with (like an API). When the Postman proxy is enabled and a client has been configured to use the proxy, a request from the client first goes to Postman, which then forwards the request on to the destination server.

If you start a debug session while the proxy is enabled, Postman can capture any HTTP or HTTPS traffic passing through the proxy. You can then search or filter the requests, or save them to a collection.

Learn more about [capturing HTTP requests](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-http-requests/) and [capturing HTTPS traffic](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-https-traffic/).

## Using Postman Interceptor

Postman Interceptor provides another way to capture requests sent between a client and a server. Interceptor uses a Chrome plug-in rather than Postman's built-in proxy. With Postman Interceptor, you can capture HTTP and HTTPS requests sent from a Google Chrome browser.

Learn more about [using Postman Interceptor](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/interceptor/).

## Capturing and syncing cookies

Along with capturing requests, Postman can capture cookies during a proxy or Interceptor debug session. You can manually add any captured cookies to the [Postman cookie jar](/docs/sending-requests/cookies/) and use them when sending requests from Postman.

Postman's built-in proxy and Interceptor also support continuous cookie syncing. Once enabled, all captured cookies for the domains you specify are automatically synced to the Postman cookie jar.
