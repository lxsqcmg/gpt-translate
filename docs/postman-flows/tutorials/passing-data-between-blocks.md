Postman Flows can get data with [API requests](/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/) or directly from the **Start** block. This tutorial shows examples of Postman Flows getting data using both methods and passing data between blocks.

## Getting data and passing it between blocks

These examples get response data with [API requests](/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/) from existing collections in your workspace and from data pasted into the **Start** block. In these examples, the entire response is passed between blocks.

### Getting data with an API request

In this example, the **Send Request** block gets data using a collection's GET request. The **Send Request** block then passes all the data to a **Log** block.

1. [Create a collection](/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/) named `Random User Collection` and add a GET request with this URL: `https://randomuser.me/api/`.

1. Select **Send**.

    ![Select Send](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-get-request-v10-2.jpg)

1. Select **Save**.

1. [Create a new flow](/docs/postman-flows/flows-intro/building-your-first-flow/) and connect a **Send Request** block to the **Start** block.

    ![Create a flow and add a Send Request block](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-data-send-request-v10-4.jpg)

1. In the **Send Request** block, select **Add request > Random User Collection > New Request**. Each time the flow executes, it will get data using the GET request from the Random User Collection request you created earlier.

    ![Select Add request](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-select-data-4-v10.jpg)

1. Connect a **Log** block to the **Send Request** block's **Success** port.

    ![Add a Log block](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-add-log-block-5-v10.jpg)

1. Select **Console** then select **Run**. The **Log** block sends the entire response to the console, including request headers, response headers, and the response body.

### Getting data from the Start block

In this example, the flow gets data from the **Start** block and passes it to an **Evaluate** block. The **Evaluate** block passes the entire response to the **Log** block in a variable.

1. [Create a new flow](/docs/postman-flows/flows-intro/building-your-first-flow/) and select the gear icon <img alt="Gear icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-settings-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> in the **Start** block.

    ![Select the gear icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-start-configure-5-v10.jpg)

1. Select **Enter Incoming Data** and paste in the sample data below. The flow will use this data every time it executes.

1. Select the **Language** dropdown list and select **JSON**.

    ![Select JSON](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-passing-data-start-5-v10.jpg)

1. Connect an **Evaluate** block to the **Start** block.
1. In the **Evaluate** block, select **value1** and enter `body`. This assigns all the data received from the **Start** block to the variable `body`.

    ![Add variable body](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-body-3-v10.jpg)

1. In the **Evaluate** block, select **Start writing an FQL query...** and enter `body`. This sends all the data in the `body` variable to the **Evaluate** block's output.
1. Connect a **Log** block to the **Evaluate** block.

    ![Connect a Log block](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-body-log-3-v10.jpg)

1. Select **Console** then select **Run**. The flow gets the data from the **Start** block, routes it to the **Evaluate** block, and passes the entire response to the **Log** block, which displays the data in the console.

## Passing specified data between blocks

You can extract specific values from response data in a number of ways using variables and [Flows Query Language (FQL)](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/). The example below uses FQL in an **Evaluate** block to get the `country` field value from sample response data in the **Start** block.

1. [Create a new flow](/docs/postman-flows/flows-intro/building-your-first-flow/) and select the gear icon <img alt="Gear icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-settings-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> in the **Start** block.

    ![Select the gear icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-start-configure-5-v10.jpg)

1. Select the **Language** dropdown list and select **JSON**.

    ![Select JSON](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-passing-data-start-5-v10.jpg)

1. Connect an **Evaluate** block to the **Start** block.
1. In the **Evaluate** block, select **value1** and enter `body`. This assigns all the data received from the **Start** block to the `body` variable.

    ![Add variable body](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-body-v10-1.jpg)

1. In the **Evaluate** block, select **Enter FQL query** and enter `body.results.location.country`. This navigates the response data with [FQL](/docs/postman-flows/flows-query-language/introduction-to-fql/) and extracts the value for the `country` field.
1. Connect a **Log** block to the **Evaluate** block.

    ![Add a Log block](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-add-log-block-data-v10-1.jpg)

1. Select **Console**.
1. Select **Run**. The **Start** block sends its data to the **Evaluate** block. The FQL in the **Evaluate** block gets the value of the `country` field (`"Norway"`) in the response data and sends it to the **Log** block. `"Norway"` appears in the console.

    ![Open the console and select Run](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/flow-console-country-2-v10.jpg)
