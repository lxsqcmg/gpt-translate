> The Postman VS Code extension is in beta.

The Postman VS Code extension enables you to develop and test your APIs in Postman directly from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The VS Code extension enables you to:

* Create and send HTTP, raw WebSocket, and gRPC requests.
* Import data with cURL commands.
* Edit and send requests from a workspace's request history.
* Create cookies and send them with requests.

To install and learn more about the VS Code extension, visit the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Postman.postman-for-vscode).
