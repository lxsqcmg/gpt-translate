> **[SSO with Azure AD is available on Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)**

To configure SSO with Azure Active Directory (AD), you can use the available Postman app in Azure AD or create a custom SAML application. You must be an administrator in both Azure AD and Postman to configure SSO for your team.

## Configuring SSO with Azure AD

Before configuring a SAML application in Azure AD, you must [configure SSO in Postman](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/). When choosing the **Authentication Type**, select **SAML 2.0**. Name your authentication and **Proceed**.

To continue configuring your SAML application, do the following:

1. Open your Azure AD management portal in a new tab.
1. Go to **Enterprise applications** and select **+ New application**.
1. Search for "Postman" and select the Postman app from the results, then select **Create**. Or, you can **+ Create your own application**.
1. Select **Set up single sign on > SAML**.
1. Take the **Entity ID**, **Login URL**, and **ACS URL** from Postman and add them to your SAML configuration in Azure AD.

1. In Postman, select **Generate relay state** and add the generated value to your SAML configuration in Azure AD.

1. Under **Attributes & Claims** in Azure AD, select **Edit > Add new claim**. Map the `Unique User Identifier (Name ID)` to the `user.mail` value.

1. **Download** the Federation Metadata XML file in Azure AD under **SAML Signing Certificate**.

1. In Postman, upload the Federation Metadata XML file under **Identity Provider Metadata File**. Or, you can enter the **Identity Provider SSO URL**, **Identity Provider Issuer**, and **X.509 Certificate** individually under **Identity Provider Details**.

1. Select **Save Authentication** in Postman.

You can test your SAML configuration by creating a test user in Azure AD and assigning them the Postman app. If you've opted to [automatically add new users](/docs/administration/sso/admin-sso/#automatically-adding-new-users) when configuring SAML, you'll be able to immediately sign in Postman with the test user's credentials to confirm the process works as expected. If you haven't opted to automatically add new users, you can manually [invite the test user](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/#inviting-users) to your Postman team and then sign in to Postman with the test user's credentials.

> If you encounter any issues, confirm you've added and saved the correct configuration values on both Postman and Azure AD. [Contact Postman support](https://www.postman.com/support/) for further help.

## Next steps

Now that you have set up SSO with Azure AD, you can learn about setting up SCIM provisioning:
