> **[Audit logs are available on Postman Professional and Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing)**

Audit logs display events related to your team, users, and billing. Team Admins can review audit logs to get information about:

* When users were added to, removed from, or invited to your team
* Which user performed a specific action and when they did so

Postman offers audit logs for 90 days to users on Professional plans, and 180 days to users on Enterprise plans.

> Audit logs are visible to all [Team Admins](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/roles-and-permissions/#team-roles) on [Postman Professional and Enterprise teams](https://www.postman.com/pricing), including Super Admins on Enterprise teams.

## Viewing audit logs in the dashboard

You can view audit logs in Postman by selecting **Team** in the header, then selecting **Audit Logs**.

Audit logs offer information about actions taken by members of your team. Each event includes the user, the user's email address, the event name and a description of the event, the user's IP address, and the date and time of the action, including the user's timezone.

You can use filters to view actions by date range, event type, and user.

## Exporting audit logs from the dashboard

You can export audit logs as CSV files. By default, Postman will export all data in your audit logs from the last seven days. To start the export process, select **Export Audit Logs**.

To specify certain data to export, set the filters you want in the audit logs dashboard and Postman will generate the export using those parameters. To filter your results, select a time range, event, and user, then select **Export Audit Logs**.

You will receive an email with a link to the exported audit logs. The link in the email is active for one hour.

## Accessing audit logs with the Postman API

You can also access audit logs with the [Postman API](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/documentation/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a), allowing you to integrate Postman's audit logs with your security information and event management (SIEM) tools.

Each audit log event has the following attributes:

| <div style="width:100px">Name</div> | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | A numeric value representing the unique identifier of an audit event. |
| `ip` | The IP address of the actor who performed the action. |
| `userAgent` | A string with the user-agent of the actor. |
| `action` | A string with an action or event performed by the actor. |
| `timestamp` | The date and time when the action or event was performed. The time is represented using the ISO 8601 date and time format. |
| `actor` | An object with information about the actor who performed this action. |
| `message` | A description of the audit event. |
| `nextCursor` | A string that represents the cursor of the next page. |

To get started, go to the [Postman API](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/documentation/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a) and open the **Audit Logs** folder to view the GET request and example responses.

> You must [generate a Postman API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key) to access the [Postman API](/docs/developer/postman-api/intro-api/).
