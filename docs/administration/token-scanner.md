The Postman Token Scanner scans your public workspaces, collections, environments, and documentation to find exposed authentication tokens. This protects your organization and prevents malicious users from exploiting the tokens.

> The Token Scanner is available on all Postman plans and is turned on by default.

## Use cases

A scan starts whenever team members do any of the following actions:

* Change the workspace visibility to Public.
* Share a collection or environment to a public workspace.
* Make changes to a collection or environment that's present in a public workspace.
* Write new documentation for a Postman Collection and make it public.

Postman delivers the scan results in the [Security audit reports](/docs/reports/security-audit-reports/) section of the [**Reports** dashboard](/docs/reports/reports-overview/).

> **[Security Audit Reports are available on Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**

## Token scanner dashboard

You can view your team's configured [default](#default-alerts) and [custom](#custom-alerts) alerts in your [data security dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/token-scanner). Select **Team** in the Postman header, then select **Team Settings**. Then, select **Data security** on the left, and select **Token scanner**.

* Airtable API Key
* Akamai API Key
* Amazon MWS Token
* Basic Auth
* Bearer Token
* Clojars Deploy Token
* Databricks Authentication Token
* DSA Private Key

### Custom alerts

You can use custom alerts to scan your team's proprietary tokens and any third-party app tokens that aren't scanned by default.

> **[Custom alerts are available on Postman Enterprise plans.](https://www.postman.com/pricing/)**

Your team can add a total of five alerts. You must be a **Community Manager** or team member with both **Developer** and **Admin** roles to add custom alerts.

To add custom alerts, do the following:

1. Go to **Team > Team Settings > Token scanner**.
2. In the **Custom alerts** section, select **Add Alert**.
3. On the **Add Alert** page, define the custom token.

## Protecting Postman API keys in GitHub

Postman also works with GitHub to ensure that your Postman API keys are secure. If you commit a valid Postman API key to a public GitHub repository, Postman notifies you by email and in-app notification. You can also set up Postman's [Slack integration](/docs/integrations/available-integrations/slack/) to alert you in Slack if this occurs.

It's recommended you delete the exposed API key in your [API keys dashboard](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys). You can then [generate a new API key](/docs/developer/postman-api/authentication/#generate-a-postman-api-key) to continue working with the Postman API.
