## Managing your team profile

Your team profile gives you a way to share important information about your team with other Postman users. The profile brings together all your team's public resources in one place, and can serve as a developer portal for your API's consumers.

Your team profile includes:

* A short summary about your team and the work you do
* Social media links like your GitHub profile
* A list containing links to your team members' profiles
* A **Team Description** section
* A **Highlights** section with pinned elements
* A **Related collections and flows** section with collections and flows using your team's APIs (suggested by Postman)
* Links to all your team's public collections, APIs, workspaces, and flows

1. In **Team settings**, select **Team profile**.
1. To add a team logo and cover photo, hover over the desired section and select the edit icon <img alt="Edit icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-edit-icon-v8-10.jpg#icon" width="18px">, then upload the image you want to use.

<img alt="Customize your team's branding" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/team-settings-customize-branding-v10.jpg" width="500px"/>

Keep the following in mind when you upload a logo, cover photo, or favicon:

* Logos and cover photos must be 500 KB or less in size and must be in **.jpg**, **.jpeg**, or **.png** format.
* Logos must have a 1:1 aspect ratio (height:width), and cover photos must have a 1:7.5 aspect ratio. If your image has a different aspect ratio, Postman prompts you to select a part of your image to display.
* Favicons must be in **.ico** format, no larger than 32x32 pixels, and 500 KB or less in size. Your favicon appears on the browser tab of your team's published documentation site.

### Making your team profile public

If you enable your team's public profile, your team will be visible on Postman's [API Network](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/adding-private-network/), along with any [APIs](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/adding-private-network/#adding-apis), [collections](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/), and [workspaces](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/public-workspaces/) your team has published.

A public team profile encourages other users to collaborate with you in a public workspace, enables you to ask for contributions and gather feedback, and increases your API's discovery in search results. A public team profile also shows up on the [Public API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore).

To make your [team profile](https://go.postman.co/settings/team/general) public, do the following:

1. In **Team settings**, select **Team profile**.
1. Select **Make team profile public** to set the profile to public.

## Making your team discoverable

You can select **Team Discovery** from the left-hand menu to view your options for making your team discoverable to other Postman users with email addresses from your team's domain.

## Adding custom domains
